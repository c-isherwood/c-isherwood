# Hi, I’m Campbell 👋

I’m a Computer Science student at Boston University (Class of 2026) with hands-on experience in
software engineering, machine learning, and applied AI systems. I enjoy building data-driven
tools that sit at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and real-world decision-making.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Go, Java, C++, SQL
- **ML / AI:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
- **Systems:** Concurrency, distributed systems, RPC
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, VS Code, Linux, Excel 

## 🚀 Featured Projects
- **Maze-Navigating AI Agent** – Autonomous agent interacting with an external simulator using
  state vectors and decision policies.
- **MLP Classifier (MNIST)** – End-to-end training, evaluation, and deployment of a neural network
  using PyTorch.
- **Distributed Weather Aggregator** – Concurrent Go system using RPC for fault-tolerant data aggregation.
- **LLM Bias Mapping** – Empirical analysis of political and cultural bias in large language models.
